# FYI
######Whenever I push changes to the robot builder file I mess up the path the the eclipse ######workspace. This will cause problems if you want to export.
#CHECK IF THE PATH TO WORKSPACE IS CORRECT.

# TODO
- Somehow fix the workspace path problem
- Test if my temporary elevator controls work.
- Fix issues with spinner motors.
- Add motor encoder to elevator once its on the robot.
